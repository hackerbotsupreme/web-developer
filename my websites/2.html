    <h2>Marriage proposal poem</h2>
    <p>    <!-- demonstration of &nbsp  -->
        &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp Being  proposed to is a moment that a woman dreams about her entire life. And if the guy is sweet enough, it’s a moment that often excites his brain too. There are so many ways you can go about it. From large-scale surprise parties to a simple one-on-one dinner, from writing in the sky to hiding the ring in her dessert.

        With so many different options, you never really know what you’re going to get. Even if you did have some grand idea that you’d been planning since you were a kid, that idea could have gone right out the window as soon as you got to know your future wife. The truth of the matter is that each proposal is going to look different for everyone.
